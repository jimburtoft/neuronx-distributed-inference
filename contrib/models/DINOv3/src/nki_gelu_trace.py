"""Exact-erf GELU NKI kernel for the torch_neuronx.trace() path on inf2.

STATUS: REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION ONLY -- MEASURED SLOWER, DO NOT ENABLE.
    Numerically exact (cos_sim 1.000000 on ViT, 0.99999 on ConvNeXt) but slower
    in 13 of 14 model/batch configurations on inf2.xlarge: ViT-S -5.8..-11.8%,
    ViT-B -7.9..-10.7%, ConvNeXt-T -8.4..-12.7%, ConvNeXt-B -7.3..-14.5%,
    ViT-L -5.5% at BS=8 and +2.8% (noise) at BS=1.
    Cause: neuronx-cc already fuses GELU into the surrounding MLP GEMMs, so a
    standalone kernel adds an HBM round-trip (load -> activate -> store) per call
    that costs more than the cheaper transcendental saves.
    Kept because it is a working, non-obvious example of the NKI `nki_jit`
    calling convention for torch_neuronx.trace() -- see the five API differences
    documented below, which are not covered in the public NKI docs.

This is a rewrite of dinov3_native_training/src/nki/gelu_fused.py using the
OLDER NKI calling convention that `torch_neuronx.trace()` actually supports.

Why the rewrite was necessary. The training project's kernel targets the
standalone `nki` wheel and the PyTorch-Native dispatch path:
    import nki                    # standalone wheel
    @nki.jit
    def gelu_fwd(input_hbm):
        R, C = input_hbm.shape             # <- unresolvable under trace()
        out = nl.ndarray(..., nl.shared_hbm)
        nisa.dma_copy(dst=x, src=input_hbm[a:b, 0:C])   # <- slice indexing
        return out                          # <- returns a value
Every one of those four things fails inside torch_neuronx.trace(), in order:
    --target gen2 rejected / failed to resolve 'nl.ndarray'
    failed to resolve name 'input_hbm.shape'
    invalid kwarg 'dtype': expecting 'enum', got 'NoneType'
    cannot perform multi-dimensional access into value of type 'NoneType'

The convention that DOES work (proven in Hunyuan sdk_inference/nki_rope.py,
which ships TP=4 NKI flash attention + RoPE through torch_neuronx.trace(), and
in the Boltz-2 nkilib submission) is:
    import neuronxcc.nki as nki           # compiler-BUNDLED nki, not the wheel
    from torch_neuronx.xla_impl.ops import nki_jit
    @nki.jit
    def kernel(x_in, x_out):              # output is a PRE-ALLOCATED PARAMETER
        d = x_in.shape[0]                 # .shape IS allowed on the bundled API
        i_p = nl.arange(P)[:, None]       # index tensors, not Python slices
        t = nl.load(x_in[i_p, i_f])       # nl.load / nl.store, not nisa.dma_copy
        y = nisa.activation(nl.gelu, t)   # RETURNS a tile; no dst= kwarg here
        nl.store(x_out[i_p, i_f], value=y)
    _k = nki_jit()(kernel)                # wrap for the XLA/trace dispatcher

Math is unchanged from the training kernel: one `nisa.activation(op=nl.gelu)`
per <=128-partition tile, i.e. exact erf GELU on the Scalar/activation engine.
This is the point of the kernel -- neuronx-cc's native erf lowering emits
1664 matmuls + 256 reciprocals + 2816 vector ops, where this emits ~26
activation-table ops, and the DINOv3 inference forward is Vector-bound (86%
active) with the Tensor engine at only 57%.
